CS 3330 - Project 2

Jay Kynerd & Kevin Leong

To run the app:

1. Update `knexfile.js` to connect to your desired database (i.e., localhost)
2. Run `npm install` within the `/app` directory to install necessary dependencies
3. Use the schema found in `db/parking_schema.sql` to make database, tables, etc.
4. Connect to the database host and run API commands.

_note: user accounts must be added manually using `post/account`, so an account must be created before sessions_
